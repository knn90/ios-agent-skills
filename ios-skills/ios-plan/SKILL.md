# Plan — iOS

Create detailed technical implementation plans through codebase analysis, ticket context,
and phased documentation.

**YAGNI + KISS + DRY.** Honest, brutal, concise.

## Plan mode (MANDATORY)
All research and design happen inside Claude Code **plan mode**. Enter it **before Step 0** —
Steps 1–4 are read-only, so nothing is written or mutated while planning. When the design is
ready, call **`ExitPlanMode`** (Step 5) with the plan summary: this is the approval gate. Only
**after** the user approves do you leave plan mode and write files (Steps 6–7) + run the handoff
(Step 8). If the host can't enter plan mode, say so, present the plan summary inline, and
require explicit approval before writing anything.

## Step 0 — Load profile
Read `.claude/ios-profile.md`: `architecture`, `state_type`, `di`, `navigation`,
`networking`, `localization`, `accessibility_ids`, `feature_flags`, `verify_command`,
`high_rigor_domains`, `plans_dir`, `source_roots`, `generated_paths`, `rules_file`,
ticket fields. If missing → run `ios-project-init`.

Plans touching `high_rigor_domains` must address security, rollback safety, feature-flag
rollout (if `feature_flags` != none), and analytics impact.

## When to Use
New feature; resolving a ticket; refactor with cascade risk; removing a feature flag;
backend schema change needing coordinated client work.

## When NOT to Use
| Case | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Single-file fix, < 20 LoC | Implement directly |
| Need trade-off analysis | `ios-brainstorm` |
| Just find files | `ios-scout` |

## Arguments
- **TICKET-ID** (matches `ticket_pattern`) → fetch via `ticket_fetch`.
- **Free-form** → planning subject.
- **Subcommands:** `archive`, `red-team`, `validate`.
- **Mode flags:** `--fast`, `--hard`, `--two`.

If no args, ask via `AskUserQuestion` (default = create plan; or archive/red-team/validate).

### Mode auto-detect
| Flag | Research | Red Team | Validate |
|---|---|---|---|
| default (auto-detect) | per complexity | per complexity | per complexity |
| `--fast` | skip | skip | skip |
| `--hard` | yes | yes | optional |
| `--two` | 2 researchers | after selection | after selection |

Auto-detect: trivial (1 file, <30 LoC) → `--fast`; single clear feature → default;
cross-module / `high_rigor_domains` → `--hard`; real uncertainty between 2 approaches → `--two`.

---

## Flow
`1` Context → `2` Codebase → `3` Research → `4` Design → **`5` ExitPlanMode (gate)** →
`6` Write → `7` Red team/Validate → `8` Handoff. Steps 1–4 read-only; 6–7 write.

### Step 1 — Context
Parse args. **Pre-creation scan:** scan `{plans_dir}` for unfinished plans
(`status != completed/cancelled`) — read frontmatter, compare scope (overlapping files,
shared DI keys, same feature), set `blockedBy`/`blocks` on BOTH plans when a dependency is
found; `AskUserQuestion` if ambiguous. Load `rules_file` + relevant `docs_root` files +
existing brainstorm report for the same ticket. Fetch ticket via `ticket_fetch`. Scope
challenge (skip if `--fast`/trivial): solving the problem or the symptom? sub-tasks
deferrable? one plan or 2-3 sequential?

### Step 2 — Codebase analysis
**Reuse first (DRY):** if a scout map already exists for this task — e.g. `scope.md` in the
working plan dir, written when `ios-resolve` ran `ios-scout` upstream — read it instead of
re-scouting. Otherwise gather it now: scope spanning 3+ modules → `ios-scout`, else `Glob`/`Grep`.
Capture per file to modify: `path:line` · existing pattern to follow (DRY) · test file + pattern ·
DI keys touched · navigation closures touched · network operations touched (never edit
`generated_paths`) · localization keys + accessibility ids needed.

### Step 3 — Research (skip if `--fast`)
`--hard`/`--two` → `ios-research <topic>`. Default → lightweight `WebSearch` only if truly
needed. **Don't research patterns already in the codebase.**

### Step 4 — Solution design
Per approach: View / state ({state_type}) / navigation split · DI wiring ({di}) · network
operation + cache strategy ({networking}) · feature flag (`feature_flags`) + default-off
rollout · backwards-compat/migration · testing strategy (unit/snapshot/UI with accessibility
ids) · rollback plan. `--two` → comparison table.

**Then derive the phase plan** (see `## Sources`):
- **Dependency graph → build order.** Map what depends on what; order bottom-up — typically
  model/persistence → networking/service → DI wiring → state/store → view → tests. Foundations first.
- **Slice vertically, not horizontally.** Each phase is ONE end-to-end feature slice (its
  model + service + state + view + tests) that leaves the app building and testable. Never
  "all models, then all APIs, then all UI." Extract a thin shared foundation phase only for
  what ≥2 slices need.
- **Order + checkpoint.** High-risk / uncertain slices first (fail-fast); every slice ends at a
  verification checkpoint ({verify_command} green); any step touching >~5 files or rated XL must
  be split.

### Step 5 — ExitPlanMode (approval gate)
Present the plan summary via `ExitPlanMode`. Nothing is written before the user approves.

### Step 6 — Plan documentation (only AFTER approval)
Out of plan mode now; writes allowed.
Dir: `{plans_dir}/{YYMMDD-HHMM}-{TICKET|slug}/` — `{YYMMDD-HHMM}` from
`bash -c 'date +%y%m%d-%H%M'`. Create if missing.

```
{plans_dir}/{date-ticket-slug}/
├── plan.md                    # master plan + frontmatter
├── phase-1-foundation.md      # thin shared scaffolding — only if ≥2 slices need it
├── phase-2-{slice-a}.md       # vertical slice: model→service→state→view→tests
└── phase-3-{slice-b}.md       # next slice; one phase per end-to-end slice
```

`plan.md` frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: <short title>
ticket: <id | n/a>
status: pending            # pending | in-progress | completed | cancelled
complexity: MEDIUM         # LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH — drives team dev-count (LOW=solo·MEDIUM=2·HIGH=3)
mode: auto                 # auto | fast | hard | two
blockedBy: []
blocks: []
created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
---
```

`plan.md` body:
```markdown
## Overview            <2-4 sentences>
## Acceptance Criteria
## Approach            <chosen + rationale; link brainstorm report if any>
## Phases              vertical feature slices in dependency order (shared foundation first only if ≥2 slices need it); each slice end-to-end + tested
## File Changes (Summary Table)  | File | Module | Type | Change | Owner |
       # Owner = dev-1/dev-2/dev-3 for team runs (one owner per file → clean merges); "-" for solo
## Feature Flag        Name / Default off / Rollout  (or "n/a" if feature_flags==none)
## Testing Strategy    Unit / Snapshot / UI (accessibility ids needed)
## Risks & Mitigations | Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
## Out of Scope
## Open Questions
```

Per-phase file:
```markdown
## Phase N: <slice name>          # one vertical slice, end-to-end
### Goal           <1-2 sentences — the user-visible capability this slice delivers>
### Steps
1. **<Step>** (file: `<path>:<line>`, size: XS/S/M/L) — what to change · why · test to add/update
       # no step > ~5 files; an XL step must be split into smaller steps
### Checkpoint        # app builds & tests green before the next slice starts
- Run `{verify_command}`  (if unset → build-only; state it)
- Manual: <if applicable>
### Estimated Effort   S / M / L
```

### Step 7 — Red team / Validate (optional)
**Red team** (`--hard`/`--two` or subcommand) — `ios-plan red-team <plan-dir>` spawns an
adversarial reviewer:
> Review this plan as a hostile reviewer. Find missing edge cases, unstated assumptions,
> security gaps, state-transition holes, DI lifecycle issues, networking/cache pitfalls,
> rollback risks, accessibility gaps. Be brutal.

Save to `{plans_dir}/{plan-dir}/red-team.md`; update the plan before proceeding.

**Validate** (optional) — `ios-plan validate <plan-dir>` via `AskUserQuestion`: ACs mapped to
phases? feature flag confirmed with PM? backend schema timing confirmed? design signed off?
localization strings provided? accessibility ids reviewed? QA bandwidth? Save to `validation.md`.

### Step 8 — Execute handoff (do NOT auto-invoke)
```
Plan ready: {plans_dir}/{plan-dir}/plan.md
- Implement now            → ios-execute {plans_dir}/{plan-dir}/plan.md
- Adversarial review first → ios-plan red-team <plan-dir>
- Validate with team       → ios-plan validate <plan-dir>
```
(When `ios-resolve` drives the flow, it runs this handoff for you.)

---

## Subcommands
- **archive** — move `status: completed|cancelled` plans → `{plans_dir}/_archive/{YYMM}/`, append journal.
- **red-team / validate** — standalone Step 7.

## Greenfield note
First 1-2 features have no prior art — the plan **establishes** the pattern. Relax the
"match existing pattern" DRY checks; be extra explicit about the conventions being set
(they become what later plans DRY against).

## Sources
Planning methodology adapted from:
- [planning-and-task-breakdown](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills/blob/main/skills/planning-and-task-breakdown/SKILL.md)
  — dependency-graph build order, vertical slicing, per-task sizing (XL→split), and checkpoint cadence.

## Constraints
- **DO NOT** implement — plans only. **DO NOT** auto-invoke `ios-execute`.
- **MUST** phase as vertical slices in dependency order — never horizontal layers
  (no "all models → all APIs → all UI"); each slice must leave the app building & green.
- **MUST** plan inside plan mode: Steps 1–4 read-only, then `ExitPlanMode` (Step 5) as the
  approval gate before any plan file is written. If the host can't enter plan mode, say so,
  present the summary inline, and require explicit approval before writing.
- **DO NOT** create plans outside `{plans_dir}`. **MUST** follow `rules_file`.
- **MUST** include `{verify_command}` in each phase's Verification (or note build-only).
- **Sacrifice grammar for concision.**
